## Overview

This is an in memory cache which stores values in key-value format. This is similar to redis and I have made it compliant with Redis Client. This can be used with Redis CLI.
I always wanted to create a database to understand how the things actually work in backend and hence I am creating this. 

## How to use ?

1) You should have redis and Go installed in your system, then clone the repository
2) Open 2 terminals in your IDE, One for running our database server other for redis-cli
3) On root folder run "go run ." Make sure nothins else running on port 6379
4) Use "redis-cli" command to run redis client
5) Now on Redis-cli you can execute the redis commands directly.
